## Stage 4: Mongoose && Models && Seeding

In this branch we introduced Mongoose and we created our first models. We then created our first models.

    - We established our database connection in app.js
    - We create our models for our records, users and orders.
    - We set up a virtual for our user model.
    - We wrote a script that will seed the database with some fake users if run.
    - We wrote a script that will purge users if run.

## Stage 3: Routing error and handling

In this branch we expanded our records endpoints and we create new ones for users and orders

    - We created DELETE and PUT for the records model
    - We created GET, POST,`PUT and DELETE for our users model
    - We created GET, POST,`PUT and DELETE for our orders model
    - We wrote a middleware function that performs basis error handling.

## Stage 2: Middleware and CORS

In this branch we created our own middleware functions

    - We created a middleware directory
    - We set up a middleware function that will add headers to each request
    - We incorporated it in our app.

## Stage 1: Mock database and controllers

In this branch we have set up our initial structure for our API

    - We created two simple routes GET and POST for our records data
    - We set up `lowdb` in order to store our data in a file
    - We then updated our routes in order to use `lowdb`
    - We created controllers for our routes in a different directory

## Stage 0: Boilerplate

This branch contains a boilerplate for almost every express server you are going to create.  
This boilerplate consists of:

- Files create by [`npx express-generator`](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html), using the `--no-view` and `--git` flags, slightly modified and modernised.

### Changes made to `express-generator` files:

- `routes/index.js` and `routes/users.js` have been updated to use `const`
- `app.js` was also updated to use `const`. In addition, comments were added to seperate the file to smaller more easily readable chunks.
